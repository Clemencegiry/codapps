= How to ask a question about the course and get an answer?
== 1. What is Github

Github is a website specializing in hosting content (mostly code but not only), providing tools for teams to collaborate easily on this content and share it.

It is very famous in the community of programmers.

Github's icon is a cat which is also an octopus:

Github is equivalent to https://bitbucket.org/product[Bitbucket], its main competitor.

Github and Bitbucket are used by all professional teams of developers.

They are convenient places to put your work and showcase it.

Actually, many employers ask to see your "Github profile" to better evaluate your skills in coding projects.

All the content of Codapps (this course) is hosted on Github: pdfs, pictures, slides... and the code of the apps we build as well.

*Among many other features, Github has a forum for Q&As.
You will be able to use this forum to search for information or ask new questions about the lessons of CODAPPS.*

== 2. You need a (free) Github account

If you don't already have a Github account, you sign in for one here: https://github.com

== 3. Asking a question on Github

[NOTE]
*A question on Github is called an "issue"*

Once you are logged in Github, simply go here:

https://github.com/seinecle/codapps/issues

- You will see the list of questions already asked and the answers. You can search for questions with the search bar!
- *You can ask a new question by hitting the green button "New issue"*

You must use a precise title (not just "it does not work"), and describe the problem in as much details as you can. Adding screenshots often helps!

You will be notified by email when somebody replies to you!

== 4. Answering questions

Do you feel like helping out fellow participants in CODAPPS? You surely can!

If you spot a question you have the answer for, or if you know the question has already been asked and answered, you are free to provide some help!
