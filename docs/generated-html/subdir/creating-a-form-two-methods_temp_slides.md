==  'Escape' or 'o' to see all sides, F11 for full screen, 's' for speaker notes


==  !

Not sure what a Form is? Have a look at the previous lesson!

==  !
Ok so if we are supposed to create our app by writing some code, where should this code be written?

NetBeans is a software with many functionalities, including text editing: you can write code directly into the files of your app, in NetBeans. These files are visible here:

==  !

==  !
*Double click* on the file `MyApplication.java` to display its content in the right panel in NetBeans:

==  !
When we created the project in the previous lesson, a Form was added to this new app by default, with a Label saying "Hi World" in it.

==  !
How was this Form and this Label added to the app?

Simply with 3 lines of code included in the file `MyApplication.java`:

==  !
IMPORTANT:: we will now show some lines of code *but you are not supposed to understand them at this stage*. It is simply to illustrate that Forms can be created with code.

(scroll down a bit in NetBeans, as these lines are in the middle of the file):


==  !
[[anchor-1]]
.MyApplication.java
[source,java]
----
public void start() {
    if(current != null){
        current.show();
        return;
    }
    Form hi = new Form("Hi World", BoxLayout.y()); // <1>
    hi.add(new Label("Hi World")); // <2>
    hi.show(); // <3>
}
----
<1> This line creates the screen with a title "Hi World".
<2> This line adds a Label saying ("Hi World") in the Form!
<3> The Form was created but was invisible. With this line, the Form appears on the screen of the phone. So you see it when the app launches!


==  !
So this is how you add a Form by writing some code in a file. But in this course, *we will first use almost no coding at all*. We will use instead a simpler approach:

==  !

In the previous lesson we had called this method the "Ikea approach": we just assemble pre-existing blocks, without designing the whole furniture ourself.

Let's see how it works:

==  !

image::Creating-a-Form-with-the-GUI---second-step.png[align="center",title="Creating a Form with the GUI - second step"]


==  !
[.stretch]
image::Creating-a-Form-with-the-GUI---third-step.png[align="center",title="Creating a Form with the GUI - third step"]


==  !
*Clicking on 'Finish' did not show you any 'Form', so what happened?* Where do I find my 'Form' and how do I use it?

==  !
[.stretch]

==  !
[.stretch]
image::Save-before-you-quit!.png[align="center",title="Save before you quit!"]


==  !
And... that's almost it! Whatever you create with the GUI Builder will be included in your app.

*Except that* if you preview your app (clicking the usual big green arrow icon in the menu of NetBeans) to admire your work, you don't see your screen but another one that says "Hi World". Why?

==  !
Even if you can create a Form with the GUI Builder, so without coding, *you still need a couple of lines of code to trigger the opening of the Form when the app launches*.

Where should these lines of code be written? As we have seen <<anchor-1,just above>>, it happens in the file 'MyApplication.java'. Here is how it looks by default:

==  !
.MyApplication.java
[source,java]
----
public void start() {
    if(current != null){
        current.show();
        return;
    }
    Form hi = new Form("Hi World", BoxLayout.y());
    hi.add(new Label("Hi World"));
    hi.show();
}
----

==  !
As you see, at no point is Form1 (the Form we created with the GUI builder) mentioned. No wonder it is not used in our app!

We just need to replace the Form currently mentioned in the code, by our Form called 'Form1'.

==  !
So, *replace* this 3 lines:

[source,java]
----
Form hi = new Form("Hi World", BoxLayout.y());
hi.add(new Label("Hi World"));
hi.show();
----

==  !
with these 2 lines:

[source,java]
----
Form1 myForm1 = new Form1();
myForm1.show();
----

==  !
Now, launching the app preview will show our Form1! It still empty but it is a good start! üéâüéâ

==  !
*This is the end of the second module. You should now be able to:*

==  !
1. understand what a Component is.
2. understand what an Action is.
3. understand what a Form is.

==  !
[start=4]
4. create a Form using simple lines of code.
5. create a Form using the Graphical User Interface (GUI).
6. understand what are the different panels of the GUI.

==  !
[start=7]
7. trigger with a couple lines of code the opening of the Form you created with the GUI.
8. create a Label
9. create a Button and attach an action to it.

==  !
*In the next module, we are going to learn how to style Components so that you can design your app exactly as you desire!*

==  The end
