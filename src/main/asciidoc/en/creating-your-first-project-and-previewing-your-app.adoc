This will be the administrative name of your app on the app store so please choose it carefully !

//ST: !
A “theme” is how your app will look like (you’ll be able to modify that later).

Please choose `Native` in the dropdown menu: this means that your app will have an Apple look on iOS, look like Android style on Android phones, etc.

//ST: !

6.	In the template, choose « Hello World (Bare Bones) ».
This means that we are going to design our app with the help of the mouse, and also use just a bit of programming (coding!) when necessary.


If you dont know which app to create, you can choose one that features one of your hobbies.

//ST: !
An idea for the name of your app would be « FirstName LastName My Passion »
