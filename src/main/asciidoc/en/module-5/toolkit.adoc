== 1. Useful additions to your coding toolkit
//ST: 1. Useful additions to your coding toolkit

//ST: !
What we have seen so far is really the essential of coding: variables, methods and classes.

We can code an app with this.
But what makes programming feel like magic is when we take advantage of three things computers (and mobile phones) are really good at:

//ST: !
1. they can adapt their behavior to changing environments
2. they are really fast
3. they can handle huge volumes of things

//ST: !
In this lesson, we learn how to do these 3 things. Promised, this is the last of the "technical" lessons.
After this one you will create a great app.

== 2. Making your app adapt
//ST: 2. Making your app adapt

//ST: !
If your app does always the same thing, it will be quickly boring.
What you need is the ability to code something that says:

"if the user of the app chooses this option, then do this. If not, do that instead"

//ST: !
This need is so universal that all programming languages have a way to express this "if this is true, then do that".

The formal name for it is a `conditional statement`.

//ST: !
==== a. How to write a conditional statement

//ST: !
[[if-example]]
.Creating a conditional statement
[source,java]
----
Float priceItemInEuros;
priceItemInEuros = 5.99f;
Label productLabel = new Label();
if (priceItemInEuros < 6) {
  productLabel.setText("cheap product!");
}
----

This will put the text "cheap product" in the Label, *only if the price of the product is under 6*.

//ST: !
Let's have a closer look at the syntax (the boring part, but where any mistake will make your build fail)

//ST: !
That's about it for conditional statements.

We have seen a condition that said "if this thing is *lower than* this other thing".

We just need to learn to write "if these things are *equal*" or "if these things are *unequal*", because these are frequent use cases:

//ST: !
==== b. How to write an "equal" and "unequal" condition

//ST: !
[[if-equal-example]]
.Equal and unequal statements
[source,java]
----
Float priceItemInEuros;
priceItemInEuros = 5.99f;
Label productLabel = new Label();
if (priceItemInEuros == 5.99) { //<1>
  productLabel.setText("the price is exactly 5.99");
}
if (priceItemInEuros != 5.99) { //<2>
  productLabel.setText("the price is different from 5.99");
}
----
<1> the `==` is surprising. Why twice `=`? Just because `=` is already taken to mean that we assign a value to a variable.
<2> `!=` looks weird, why not just `â‰ `? Well try to find â‰  on your keyboard ðŸ˜‰

//ST: !
Before we leave conditional statements: we'll see in the app that we use them *a lot* because they make the app so powerful and flexible.

Some even joke that many products with "artificial intelligence" sold out there actually just have plenty of conditional statements in their code to mimic an "intelligent behavior" ðŸ˜‰

//ST: !
(for example, you could build a chat bot with conditional statements: "if the person asks x, answer this". "if they asks y, answer that". Etc...)

== 3. Making your app go fast
//ST: 3. Making your app go fast

//ST: !
Computers can do things quickly, we know that. If you write these three lines of code:

//ST: !
[[three-statements]]
.Three lines of code
[source,java]
----
Float priceItemInEuros = 5.99f;
Label priceLabel = new Label();
priceLabel.setText(priceItemInEuros);
----

//ST: !
Your mobile phone will run these lines of code in less than a millisecond.

But to make your app do thousands of things per second, do we need to write thousand lines of code to describe each of these things?

Certainly not.

//ST: !
Actually, many things happen in loops. The computer does one thing, and as it is in a loop, it gets repeated for as long as you need.

//ST: !
Is the loop repeating 1000 times the same thing?
No! If you put a conditional statement in the loop (see above for conditional statements!), then each turn of the loop can do something different. Clever!

Ok, how to write loops?

//ST: !
==== a. How to write loops

//ST: !
There are many ways to write loops, but here is a common way:

//ST: !
[[loop]]
.Writing a loop
[source,java]
----
for ( int i = 0; i<100; i = i+1){
  System.out.println("I looped " + i);
}

----

//ST: !
Before we have a closer look at what these lines of code mean, let's see what they do in practice:

Here is the solution:

//ST: !
Just like for the conditional statements, the way to write a loop looks a bit barbarian, with plenty of `( )` and `;` and `{ }`

Don't worry, it is not about memorizing everthing by heart, but simply to at least get the general picture.

Then you can have the cheat sheet (availabe in this module) printed next to you when you code, as a helper.

//ST: !
==== b. a closer look at the syntax

//ST: !
So let's have a closer look at what we did:

//ST: !

//ST: !
You don't need to memorize perfectly how to write for loops, just pay attention to...

//ST: !
- the semi-colon `;` -> did you notice there were two of these in the first line? They are essential.
- the opening and closing brackets, followed at the end of the line by a `{`
- the closing `}` which marks the end of what's enclose in the loop.

//ST: !
Your app can now go fast!

That's about it for the loops.
We'll meet them again just below, in a simpler version.
