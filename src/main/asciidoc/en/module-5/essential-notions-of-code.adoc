== 1. The interactive tool we are using to learn the basics of code
//ST: 1. The interactive  we are using to learn the basics of code

//ST: !
It is useful to learn about coding by reading a lesson like this one, but it is more efficient if you can *practice while you read*.

Indeed, a key competency in coding is to learn the simple discipline of writing text carefully:

//ST: !
- not forgetting a `;` at the end of the line
- not forgetting to put a capitalized letter when it is necessary
- learning how to spot opening accolades `{` and closing accolades `}`
- not confusing when to use commas `,` and semi-colons `;`

//ST: !
It is all very trivial, right? And yet this is what needs the most practice, at the start.

//ST: !
So in this lesson, you will see plenty of interactive screens like this one:

//ST: !
You can write your code directly on it in this lesson, and and "launch it" to see the results. Here is an explanation of how this works:

//ST: !
Last note before we start: this lesson is on the [underline]#essentials# of coding, so we go fast and discuss just the most important notions of coding.

If you are interested in (much) longer, more thorough approaches, you can have a look at these two interactive courses:

//ST: !
- https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/index.html["Think Java"] by Tinklet (Java is the same programmming language as the one we use here)
- https://books.trinket.io/pfe/index.html["Python for Everybody"] also by Tinklet (Python is the most popular programming language for data science)

== 1. Variables
//ST: 1. Variables

//ST: !
If we compare coding to cooking, you could say that `variables` are the ingredients of the recipe.

If we develop a gaming app, we need to have characters and animate them, show their names on screen, record scores...

-> variables are a way to create, define and store all these things we need in our program.

//ST: !
[TIP]
====
You can create all the kinds of variables you want, but to help you, a number of them are already predefined because they are so common:
====

//ST: !
A variable is created and defined this way:

//ST: !
[[anchor-1]]
.Creating a variable
[source,java]
----
String playerName = "Bernard B";
----

What does all this mean? Let's decompose each term:

//ST: !
- `String`: The capital *S* is mandatory. It means this variable specializes in storing *text*. This is the *type* of the variable.
- `player`: this is the name I chose for the variable, it could have been anything else. By convention it always starts *without* a capitalized letter and it has *no space* in it.
- `=`: the right of the equal sign will be the value of the variable.
- `"Bernard B"`: this is the value I store in the variable `player`. *Textual values should be put between quotes " "*.
- `;`: this step of code is finished a the end of the line. The `;` shows this end and *is mandatory* (if you don't put it, the program tries to read the next line as the direct continuation of this one, and it gets confused).

//ST: !
[[anchor-1]]
.Creating a variable
[source,java]
----
String playerName = "Bernard B";
----

So this single line of code creates a variable called playerName, and I immediately give it a value: "Bernard B".

//ST: !
This will be handy when we need to show the player's name on the screen of the app: we will just use the variable `player`, and what ever value in it (the player's name) will be shown.

//ST: !
Try to create a variable by yourself:

[WARNING]
====
You need to put the name of your variable in the line "System.out.println..." if you want to see the result on screen, just like below
