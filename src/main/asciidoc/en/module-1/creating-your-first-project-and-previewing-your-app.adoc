//ST: !
Then click on `Next` to move to the next screen.

//ST: !
- Choose a name and a location for your project. Since the app will be about one of your interests / hobbies, choose in accordance!

[WARNING]
====
*Put no space in the name of your app*
- No special characters like - _# »& @

//ST: !
We will explain in turn what package name, theme and template you should choose:

//ST: !
==== 1. The "package name"

This is the official id of your app. Basically, this is the way for Google or Apple to give an ID card to your app.

It should be unique: one package name for each different app you create.

//ST: !
The package name should contain at least three parts separated by dots. The default value suggested `com.mycompany.myapp`

[WARNING]
====
*You should change this default value*.
====

//ST: !
How can we find a unique package name for an app?

The convention is to take the name of your website and reverse it:

-> if you build apps for emlyon (www.em-lyon.com), you’d have a package name like : com.emlyon.myfirstapp

//ST: !
If you don’t own a website, you can use the reverse of your email address. If your email is barackobama@gmail.com, your package name could be:

`com.gmail.barackobama.myfirstapp`

//ST: !
==== 2. The "theme"

This defines the general colors and appearance of your app, how it will look like (you’ll be able to modify that later).

//ST: !
Please choose `Native` in the dropdown menu: this means that your app will have an Apple look on iOS, look like Android style on Android phones, etc.

//ST: !
==== 3. The "template"

In the dropdown menu, choose the template « Hello World (Bare Bones) ».

This template allows us to design our app both with by drawing on screen and by programming (coding!).

Other templates would provide us with apps already prebuilt in some ways, we don't use them.

//ST: !
Click on `Finish` and your app will be created.

//ST: !
==== 4. Done! Preview your app.

//ST: !

//ST: !
1. The files of your app appear on the left of your screen in NetBeans.
2. You can launch the preview of your app by clicking on the green arrow.

//ST: !
It should show a blank screen with "Hi World": in the next lesson, we will add a new screen, text and pictures!
