We are developing an app on NetBeans, with a plugin with installed, called "Codename One".

But how do we go from there to an app available on the Play Store (for Android phones) or Appe's App Store (for iPhones and tablets)?

==  !
The workflow has several steps:

==  !
- we design our app in NetBeans until we are satisfied with it and ready to test it on a phone
- then, we choose in NetBeans if we want to create an Android or an iPhone version of our app.
- we send our app to www.codenameone.com which is the website of the company providing the plugin we use.

==  !
- Codename One transforms our app into an Android app or iPhone app (depending on what we selected). In practice, it is a single file which is created.
- we can download this file on our own phone if we want to test the app.
- or we download this file and place it on the website of the App Store or the Play Store if we want to release the app publicly.

==  !
These steps can be illustrated simply:
